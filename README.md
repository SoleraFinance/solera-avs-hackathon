### What is Solera?

Solera (solera.finance) is an inter-chain stable coin backed by collateralized debt positions (CDP). 

With Solera, you can lock your assets as collateral on any supported chain, and mint native stable coins on a same or another chain of your choosing.

You can also move stable coins from one chain to another without going through bridges, paying fees or taking on additional risks. 

Solera runs as an EigenLayer Active Validated Service (AVS) 

### Why do we need another stable coin?

In today's world of trading opportunities being scattered across multiple blockchains, one needs to be able to move funds quicly between chains. At the same time, it might not be wise selling your current holdings, especially if they are yield bearing, to take advantage of another trade. Soleras inter-chain capabilities provide an opportunity to borrow stable assets on any chance you want against collateral on any chain you have them. 

### How does Solera keep its peg?

Solera uses a well known CDP based design, that was pioneered by projects like MakerDAO (DAI) and Liquty (LUSD) and has proved to be extremely stable even in the most challenging market conditions. When collateral prices are declining, Solera uses an incentivized stability pool to cover the positions that drop below the minimal collateralization ratios. Additional mechanisms, such as debt socialization and direct redemption are utilized to maintain the peg at all times.

### What is Solera AVS?

Solera AVS is a decentralized coordination layer backed by Eigen Layer stakers. It is responsible for maintaining a coherent state across multiple blockchains and validate all protocol operations
